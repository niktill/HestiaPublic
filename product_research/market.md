# Market

## Market Landscape
We are attempting to disrupt the sports analytics market, specifically for Rugby. Over the past few years, there has been an increasing adoption in the usage of analytics software and more sports are looking to these software in a bid to improve the performance of their athletes and to give themselves an edge over their competitors.

## Market Opportunity
### Main Players in the Industry
Based on our research, we have found that there isn't a direct competitor that is doing exactly what we are doing â€” using IMU data to enhance the performance of Rugby athletes.
However, there are competitors who are also looking to enhance the performance of Rugby athletes, albeit in different ways. These competitors include Sparta Science, Zone7 and
IMeasureYou.


### Main Problems We Are Solving
Rugby is an intensive sport with plenty of physical contact. Being exposed to prolonged periods of intensive physical contact can result in the deterioration of an
athlete's performance and subsequently, the team's ability to win games. By utilising data gathered from athletes wearing IMUs, we are hoping to predict the injury risk of
athletes and to enhance their performance by ensuring that they are in peak condition for games.

### Main Users in This Market
Sports teams, especially those competing in professional leagues, will be the main users in this market. College/university teams and amateur teams 
that can afford to buy products are also included.  
From the geographic perspective of view, the main users will be the teams in Canada. Due to the limited size of the Canadian market, however, 
our start-up plans to expand into the market to U.S and U.K in the future.

### Competitive Analysis
Since the market share of the sports analytics market is so diverse, it's difficult to say how many competitors we have.
As a result, we narrowed the field to competitors that provide a product that enhances performance while lowering injury risk.  
Zone7 is a direct competitor of ours. It analyzes the risk of injury based on client data collected from matches and sends an email 
to the customer with the results.  
Sparta Science is an indirect competitor of ours. It produces and analyzes its own data using a force plate. In addition, it uses its own 
metrics to view health scores or injury risk on the mobile or web application.
