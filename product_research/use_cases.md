### Use Cases

The following list captures our 6 use cases to capture our first engineering targets. The use cases were created to be short and concise.

1. Coaches can create athlete profiles.

2. Coaches can upload IMU data for each athlete.

3. Number of impacts and max acceleration can be determined from IMU data.

4. Given the player’s data in use case 2, an impact limit will be determined for each player. This impact limit will represent the amount of impacts a player received before showing a decrease in their max acceleration.

5. Athlete’s profile will include charts of number of impacts and max acceleration by date.

6. Email alerts will be sent to coaches after IMU data for an athlete is uploaded and it is determined they received a number of impacts over or near their impact limit.
